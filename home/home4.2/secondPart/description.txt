The program demonstrates the use of the adapter design pattern in the context of fashion. The main goal is to create an adapter for an old class that only displays a description of a garment and implement a new interface that supports displaying both a description and an image of a garment.

Program files:

1. ModernFashionDisplay.java: An interface that supports displaying a description and an image of a garment.
2. LegacyFashionDescription.java: An old class that only supports displaying clothing descriptions.
3. FashionDisplayAdapter.java: An adapter that implements the `ModernFashionDisplay` interface and uses the old `LegacyFashionDescription` class to display the description, and executes the new code to display the image.
4. Main.java: The main class where the adapter is tested, displaying both the description and the image of the clothes.

The program allows to use the old class to display the description of clothes through a new interface that allows to display both the description and the image, while maintaining the existing code and adding new functionality.
